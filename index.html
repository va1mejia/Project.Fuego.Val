<!--Welcome to "Projects Fuego..." Just follow along with comments like this one, and you'll design a really cool webtext that not only introduces you, your skills, and interests to the rest of the class, but also builds your coding literacy. Refer to the repository README for GitHub publishing help.-->

<!--BTW. You can leave these faded code comments be, or delete them. Programmers and web designers use these comments to better explain what the code is doing for others who may enter the document later. They are but road signs, absent from the larger design-->

<!--HTML pages start by calling <!DOCTYPE html> and designating a language.-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <!--Next comes the <head> information including the title and all of the important links that make the webtext work. When a browser access your url, it looks first at the index.html document <head> to learn about the names and locations of the other files and assets it will need to assemble your code into a visual display.-->

  <!--Go ahead and fill in the blank in <title>I am...</title> (see just below). The <title> will appear in your document's browser tab-->
<title>I am...</Valerie!>
<!--The stuff below the title does important work to tell browsers what this page should look like on different screens-->

<!--Next is a link to the cascading style sheet or CSS. Web designers use a cascading stylesheet CSS to add styling to a website. Designers do this by "calling" a <div class> in HTML and defining the class attributes on the style sheet. Doing so saves time and results in less code. On the style.css page you'll find attributes relating font, text size, image size, among other details.-->
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">

<body>
<!--Now we will start working in the body of the document. The body holds all of the code and content that will appear as a visual for our audience.-->

<!--Designers refer to this next section as a "Hero Image." The hero image is styled on the style.css page by calling a "class." To replace the hero image, simply place a .jpg file in the same file folder (directory) as this project and name it "hero.jpg." Alternatively, if you are working with a .png, you will need to open the style.css file using your text editor, find the "hero-image" class and change the file type from ".jpg" to ".png."" Browsers will only work with .jpg, .jpeg, or .png images. Since hero images need to stretch across the screen, typically you will want to select an image 1200px in width to allow quick load time yet avoid pixilation.-->

<!--We'll use this first section to discuss where you are right now. Where do you go to school and what courses are you taking/enjoying. What majors/minors/certificates are you pursuing? Has this changed? Why? Replace the content between <h3> and </h3> that says "Lorem ipsum" etc -->


<!--Fuego programs sometimes use "in-line styling" to provide quick fixes to content design. In the above case, you could change "left" to "right" or "center" depending on your specific design needs. That said, left align is usually best practice for improving readability.-->

  <h2>Field of Study</h2>
  <h3>I attend the University of Pittsburgh and my major is Natural Sciences with a minor in Chemsitry. The classes I am currently taking are Genetics, Organic Chemistry, Physics, Biology Lab 1, Intro to Africana Studies and this course. I enjoy sciences classes, because everyday I learn something new and challenges my understanding of different topics we see in the world today. </h3>

<!--Replace the images here. You can also control max-image width%. Keep your file names simple, don't use spaces, and be case sensitive). Be sure to add alt="text." Visually impaired individuals using screen readers rely on alt="text" to describe pictures to them. Describe your image as clearly and succinctly as possible.-->

  <h2>Knowledge, Tools, and Skills</h2>
    <h3> My past experience in writing courses have helped me achieve higher comprehension and writing skills. I used to be a Computational Biology major, which will help a lot with the coding we are using to create projects, such as this one. I am 100% a maker. I like to do things in which I can create something, like a painting, picture, music, etc. I think I am also a thinker. I like to try and challenge myself to come up with something new, creative, or outside the box. I don't know much about digital design, so everything will be pretty much new to me. I know I am going to learn so many things that I have never even heard of and I am really excited to see where this class will go and what it will look like.</h3>

<!--Quick fact: Did you know "Lorem ipsum," the fill text used in this web template, was hacked out of Cicero's "De finibus bonorum et malorum"? Developers made it non-sensical, so don't bother with Google Translate.-->

  <h2>Potential Project</h2>
      <h3>During my summers in Colombia, I always make it a mission to contribute to my parent's home country. Over the years, I have collected hundreds of schools supplies, including backpacks, notebooks, and other essential schools supplies. I try to find a school that is in need of these supplies and donate everything I collect to those students. When I have visited the schools, it has been such an eye opening experience. To see their little faces light up to something as small as a pack of crayons, brings me such joy that I can make a tiny difference in these students lives. Although I don't visit Colombia as much as I want to, it is something I hope to keep doing every single time I visit.  </h3>

<!--Let's talk a little about the future. After school what kind of job or career would you like to pursue? What is your reasoning for going on this path? How might it connect to all of these prior elements-field of study, home and family, interests and activities? How might the work we do in this space help you to realize this future?-->

   <h2>In the Future</h2>
      <h3>I am currently a senior, which means that my future plans are coming faster than I ever thought they would. After graduating, I will be taking a gap year before applying to medical school. I am hoping to obtain my EMT/Paramedic license in order to gain more clinical/patient hours that are needed to apply for medical school. I am hoping to become a neurologist and eventually work as a doctor without borders. This has always been a dream of mine since I was younger and I have my entire family and friends supporting me. I know the time and energy going into medical school is a lot, but I think in the end it is going to be worth every single minute that I spent studying or working. </h3>
